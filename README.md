## Reading History 
### [Game-Tree Properties and MCTS performance](Articles/4_Done/Game-Tree-Properties-and_MCTS_performance_-_Finnsson_and_Bjornsson.pdf)
*Finnsson and Bjornsson*

Measure the effect of high level game properties (features) on the effectiveness of using MCTS, compared f.x. to $\alpha\beta$ search. Done using specially designed games that exploit the given properties.

### [TL General Game Learning using Knowledge Transfer](Articles/3_Reading/How_transferable_are_features_in_deep_neural_networks.pdf)
*Bikramjit Banerjee and Peter Stone - 2007*

Transfering knowledge from one game to another by means of automatic feature detection which is implemented by coalescing subtrees with terminal states (depth 2). Q-values from source game from a specific feature is used to initialize the Q-values of the corresponding feature in the target game (same feature = same Q-value).
