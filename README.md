### [Game-Tree Properties and MCTS performance - Finnsson and Bjornsson](/Users/frimann/Dropbox/2018_sumar_Tolvunarfraedi_HR/Transfer Learning MS/GitRepositoryTL/Articles/4 Done/Game-Tree Properties and MCTS performance - Finnsson and Bjornsson.pdf)

Measure the effect of high level game properties (features) on the effectiveness of using MCTS, compared f.x. to $\alpha\beta$ search. Done using specially designed games that exploit the given properties.

Transfering knowledge from one game to another by means of automatic feature detection which is implemented by coalescing subtrees with terminal states (depth 2). Q-values from source game from a specific feature is used to initialize the Q-values of the corresponding feature in the target game (same feature = same Q-value).
